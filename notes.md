## Two Pointers

The two pointers approach is useful for problems involving arrays or linked lists. 
Using two pointers helps us avoid using nested/multiple loops.
The two pointer approach enables us to process two elements per loops instead of one. 
This improves time complexity, for instance taking the complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

Common two pointer patterns:
-One starting from the end and one from the beginning, moving inward until they converge
-One pointer moving at a slow pace and the other moving at a faster pace
